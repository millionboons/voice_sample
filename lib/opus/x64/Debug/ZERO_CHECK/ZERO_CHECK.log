  -- Opus package version from package_version file: 1.5.2
  -- Opus project version: 1.5.2
  -- Performing Test VLA_SUPPORTED -- failed to compile
  -- Check SIMD support by compiler
  -- The following features have been enabled:
  
   * OPUS_ENABLE_FLOAT_API, compile with the floating point API (for machines with float library).
   * OPUS_HARDENING, run-time checks that are cheap and safe for use in production.
   * OPUS_INSTALL_PKG_CONFIG_MODULE, install pkg-config module.
   * OPUS_INSTALL_CMAKE_CONFIG_MODULE, install CMake package config module.
   * OPUS_USE_ALLOCA, use alloca for stack arrays (on non-C99 compilers).
   * OPUS_STACK_PROTECTOR, use stack protection.
   * OPUS_X86_MAY_HAVE_SSE, does runtime check for SSE1 support.
   * OPUS_X86_MAY_HAVE_SSE2, does runtime check for SSE2 support.
   * OPUS_X86_MAY_HAVE_SSE4_1, does runtime check for SSE4.1 support.
   * OPUS_X86_MAY_HAVE_AVX2, does runtime check for AVX FMA AVX2 support.
   * OPUS_X86_PRESUME_SSE, assume target CPU has SSE1 support (override runtime check).
   * OPUS_X86_PRESUME_SSE2, assume target CPU has SSE2 support (override runtime check).
  
  -- The following OPTIONAL packages have been found:
  
   * Git
  
  -- The following features have been disabled:
  
   * OPUS_BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY, build shared library.
   * OPUS_BUILD_TESTING, build tests.
   * OPUS_CUSTOM_MODES, enable non-Opus modes, e.g. 44.1 kHz & 2^n frames.
   * OPUS_BUILD_PROGRAMS, build programs.
   * OPUS_DISABLE_INTRINSICS, disable all intrinsics optimizations.
   * OPUS_FIXED_POINT, compile as fixed-point (for machines without a fast enough FPU).
   * OPUS_FLOAT_APPROX, enable floating point approximations (Ensure your platform supports IEEE 754 before enabling).
   * OPUS_ASSERTIONS, additional software error checking.
   * OPUS_FUZZING, causes the encoder to make random decisions (do not use in production).
   * OPUS_CHECK_ASM, enable bit-exactness checks between optimized and c implementations.
   * OPUS_DNN_FLOAT_DEBUG, Run DNN computations as float for debugging purposes.
   * OPUS_DRED, enable DRED.
   * OPUS_OSCE, enable OSCE.
   * OPUS_STATIC_RUNTIME, build with static runtime library.
   * OPUS_FIXED_POINT_DEBUG, debug fixed-point implementation.
   * OPUS_VAR_ARRAYS, use variable length arrays for stack arrays.
   * OPUS_NONTHREADSAFE_PSEUDOSTACK, use a non threadsafe pseudostack when neither variable length arrays or alloca is supported.
   * OPUS_FAST_MATH, enable fast math (unsupported and discouraged use, as code is not well tested with this build option).
   * OPUS_X86_PRESUME_SSE4_1, assume target CPU has SSE4.1 support (override runtime check).
   * OPUS_X86_PRESUME_AVX2, assume target CPU has AVX FMA AVX2 support (override runtime check).
